Chapter 2: Structure of atom

Important points

-Atomic number(Z):Number of protons in an atom
                 :Number of neutrons in an atom

-Mass number: Number of protons+Number of neutrons

-Dalton's Atomic Theory:
*Atoms are indivisible and indestructible.
*Atoms of the same element are identical in all aspects.
*Atoms of different elements have different masses and properties.
*Compounds are formed by the combination of atoms of different elements in small whole numbers.

-Thomson's Model of Atom:
*Discovered electrons through cathode ray tube experiments.
*Proposed the "plum pudding" model where electrons are embedded in a positively charged sphere.

-Rutherford's Model of Atom:
*Discovered the nucleus through the gold foil experiment.
*Proposed that the atom consists mostly of empty space with a small, dense, positively charged nucleus.

-Bohr's Model of Atom:
*Electrons revolve around the nucleus in fixed circular orbits or shells.
*Each orbit corresponds to a specific energy level or energy state.
*lectrons can only exist in these discrete energy levels and cannot exist between them.
*Electrons can absorb or emit energy as they move between energy levels.

-Electronic Configuration:
*It describes the arrangement of electrons in various orbitals around the nucleus.
*Electrons occupy orbitals in order of increasing energy levels.

-Aufbau Principle:
*Electrons fill orbitals starting from the lowest energy level to higher energy levels.

-Pauli’s Exclusion Principle:
*No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers.

-Hund’s Rule:
*Electrons fill orbitals of the same energy level singly before pairing up.

Important formuals:

1) Bohr's radius: 0.529*n^2/Z A

2)En= -13.6*Z^2/n^2 eV/atom

3) E=hv
